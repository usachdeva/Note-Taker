## Getting Started

On the back end, the application should include a `db.json` file that will be used to store and retrieve notes using the `fs` module.

The following API routes should be created:

-   `POST /api/notes` should receive a new note to save on the request body, add it to the `db.json` file, and then return the new note to the client. You'll need to find a way to give each note a unique id when it's saved (look into npm packages that could do this for you).
